# Numpadmouse
Transforming the numeric keypad in a mouse.

**Language: C**

**Start: 2007**

## Why
I developed this tool to allow me to move the mouse using the [numpad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeric_keypad). Years after I finished this I found out about [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) which is way better (since it is generic) and works perfectly! Anyway, this project helped in understanding [Windows Hooks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winmsg/hooks).

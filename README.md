# Numpadmouse
Transforming the numeric keypad in a mouse.

**Language: C**

**Start: 2007**

## Why
I developed this tool to allow me to move the mouse using the [numpad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeric_keypad). Years later I finished this I found out about [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) which is way better (since it's generic) and it works perfectly!
